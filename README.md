**Beatz-roll** is a simple rhythm editor created for our learning activity's "Proble-Solving" part, in the context of the CS-411 Digital Education course. Give it a go over the [live website here.](https://truddytheduddi.github.io/piaroll/)

## Features

Our editor allows users to easily compose rythms and let them visualize their traditional notation equivalent. By easily selecting symbols (both various notes and rests) and placing them on the staff, they are able to see how different time signatures affect the splitting of the symbols they've used to write their rhythm patterns. 

We additionally offer a song selector that allows them to experiment with their beat making and/or rythm recognition skills by imitating what they hear.
